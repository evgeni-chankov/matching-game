# matching-game
This is a simple memory game.

Upon starting the game, the user is prompted to select one of three game modes. This determines the types of values they have to match.
After completing a session the user is greeted with a modal, detailing their performance, including time taken, number of moves, stars (between 1 and 3, based on moves) and the name of the difficulty they had chosen.

TODO: 
- include an OMG mode (hardest difficulty, including a countdown timer, instead of a regular one.)\
- various effects based on progressing time and player performance
- additional tile content
